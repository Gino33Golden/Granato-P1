                                <p>I am in my final year at Freehold Township High School and look to graduate on time. During my four years there, I took many honors and AP courses ranging from English, Web Design, and History. Continuing on the web design, I was in a three year program starting my sophmore year and I learned different languages and styles to make a website. Some of my projects can be found in the "Extra" section.</p>
                                <div>
                                    I have many future plans on what I'm going to do after high school. Those include:
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Go to college. I have applied to six colleges and as of 11/17/21, I got accepted into Seton Hall. In college, I want to join a lot of clubs and maybe become a board member for one of them.</li>
                                      <li>Graduate college. Not only do I want to go to college. I also want to graduate on time. I have a pretty good idea of my college degree. A major in Computer Science and a minor in Film. I have always been intrested in film, which I talked about in my about page.</li>
                                      <li>Get a job. I really enjoy making websites and I always thought it was cool to put anything you want in there. I also have a lot of experiance in it as I was in a three year program in highschool. Not only that, I also want to become a film director and one day make my own movies.</li>
                                    </ul>
